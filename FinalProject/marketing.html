    <ul>
        <li>Identify your target audience based on who you'd like to see interact with your brand. Oftentimes, brands target a specific demographic based on how much a brand anticipates them to spend. The more passionate you are about who your customers are, the more natural it will feel to create content for them.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>If possible, expand and diversify the teams responsbile for your brands' content. Remember, diversity looks like multiple people with different experiences, perspectives, and ideas - not multiple people or ideas with similar differences.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Sharing yourself and your personal journey alongside your brand is a great way to build intimacy between you and your audience
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>When sharing your personal journey, we urge you to share it all. Sharing the bumps in the road as well as the successes maintains authenticity in where you are in the process. This establishes a trust and connection between your brand and its audience.
        </li>

        <li>You or your brands’ personal growth must be at the forefront of your mind and ultimately reflected in your content.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Committing to personal growth also means new and refreshed energy, ideas and perspectives. This leads to new ideas for your content.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Featuring other people on your platforms outside of yourself or your team can also be a huge help. This builds more diversity and simultaneously builds a fan base.

<p id="issuepar"> Time and time again, we see the culture gravitate towards what is trending, not necessarily what is authentic or unique. This is, in part, due to the fact that the algorithms behind social media platforms are trained on sameness. They look for what you interact with, and pour more and more of that type of content onto your feed or “for you page”. These algorithms are “taste-reflectors” which means they reinforce your palate and leave no room for discovery. As sameness persists, sales diversity declines which means we are increasingly consuming the same content. This is why “the culture” exists in the first place. On the internet we gather around the same ideas and the same people. This puts a spotlight on the overrecognized few and ignores the under recognized many. Thus, one voice is projected and lifted at the expense of many others. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In the real world, someone’s success doesn’t necessarily lead to your failure. But on the internet, someone’s success can absolutely equate to your failure. The internet was originally created for every voice and everyone. But capitalism has led us to prioritizing the individual star or idea, drowing out the rest. Niche is out and monoculture is in. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Artists who are overlooked now have interesting ideas that have the potential to push the discourse forward in some way shape or form. But instead we choose virality, and we only recognize content surrounding the same idea over and over againjust repackaged and reshared in a different way. And because of the loudness at which this singular idea or trend is being projected, we associate this with quality. That’s the irony of the internet. Even though we all “have a voice,” we only project a few ideas over and over and over again. But understand that mass projection doesn’t necessarily equate to quality, it’s moreso a reflection of familiarity.

    <p id="issuepar"> We need to acknowledge that genuine diversity of thought, thus diversity of content, means more that is different, not more of the same differences. There are so many different perspectives, voices that are untapped and unacknowledged. In order to start diversifying what’s consumed, accepted, and celebrated, we must tap into them.

            DISPROPORTIONATTE EFFECTS ON MINORITY GROUPS 
            <br>
            <br>
            Gentrified areas see an increase in white non-Hispanic people and non-gentrified low-income areas see an increase 
            <br>
            in minority groups. As gentrification persists, minority low-income communities are pushed out of their homes,
            <br>
            ultimately leading to segregation. Large cities such as Detroit, Philadelphia, and areas within New York City have 
            <br>
            lots of gentrification. Over the past few years, gentrification has been an increasingly pressing issue  
            <br>
            due to the pandemic. This time in history brought attention to the rough policing against people of color. 
            <br>
            The more segregation becomes prevelant, the more targeted minority areas become.
            <br>
            <br>
            A Standford University study observed the disproportionate effects of gentrification on minority groups. 
            <br>
            It found that people moving from neighborhoods that are non-predominantly black have more housing options as they are 
            <br>
            less likely to face rent discrimination. They specifically found that Black communities face additional constraints 
            <br>
            when moving to lead them to move to affordable yet disadvantaged neighborhoods that have less access to public transportation and resources.

            EMINENT DOMAIN
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the main factors advancing gentrification is Eminent Domain. Eminent Domain is the government acquisition of private 
            <br>
            property for public use. It pushes modern development in once-underdeveloped areas. Governments often utilize this tactic to
            <br>
            display people of color out of their neighborhoods in the name of urban renewal and modernization. But the issue with Eminent 
            <br>
            Domain is that these modern redevelopments increase the cost of living in the area whether that’s property taxes, 
            <br>
            the cost of groceries, etc. Between 1949 and 1973, eminent domain displaced one million people… ⅔ of them being African-American. 
            
            This made black people five times more likely to be displaced than white people. The disproportionate effects of gentrification 
            and eminent domain on minority communities are undeniable. Now we must ask ourselves… how can we solve this issue?

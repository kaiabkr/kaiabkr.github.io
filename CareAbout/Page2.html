                        WHAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH TO SOLVING THIS ISSUE?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In efforts to protect and better the quality of living for displaced minority communities, cities should 
                        <br>
                        aim to desegregate these neighborhoods. They could approach this by stabilizing property taxes for those 
                        <br>
                        living in gentrified and mixed-income communities. Cities should also allocate more and better quality 
                        <br>
                        resources for low-income minority communities. While modernization is not an entirely negative initiative, 
                        <br>
                        redevelopment projects need to have widespread benefits that allow current residents to remain in their neighborhoods.

                        Ultimately, racial wealth disparities and discrimination require attention in order to address gentrification.
                        <br>
                        Governments at all levels must address these issues by acknowledging their impact on minoritiesâ€™ access to

                        housing and employment resources.
